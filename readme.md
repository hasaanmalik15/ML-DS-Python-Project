<h2>Python Machine Learning and Data Science Project</h2>

This project is all about Python programming project that encompasses data analysis, dimensionality/feature analysis, dimensionality/feature selection, machine learning model development, model evaluation, and the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

In this Python project, I engaged in a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, aiming to extract meaningful insights and build predictive models. The dataset I have selected is the diabetes dataset for diabetes prediction. The projects key components are below:

Data Analysis: Thoroughly examining the dataset to understand its structure, contents, and relationships. Data visualization and descriptive statistics play a crucial role in gaining insights.

Dimensionality/Feature Analysis: This phase involved exploring the dimensions (features) of the dataset, including identifying correlations and relationships between features. Relevance and importance of individual dimensions/feature were assessed. 

Dimensionality/Feature Selection: Based on the previous analysis, I selected the three most important and relevant features while eliminating unnecessary or redundant ones. Feature selection enhances model efficiency and interpretability. Recursive Feature Elimation (RFE) was also used for feature elimation and to identify the most important three features.

Machine Learning Model Development: In ths phase, I developed a Logistic Regression Machine Learning model for prediction on my diabetes dataset with the selected features. 

ML Model Evaluation: After model development, I evaluated the model to assess its performance. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, based on the confusion matrix.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA was used for dimensionality reduction. By projecting the data onto a lower-dimensional subspace, PCA helps eliminate noise, reduce computational load, and can improve model performance. Again the Logistic Regression ML Model was developed with the PCA components. Results of both models were analysed. 

Overall, this project is all about Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Dimensionality/Feature Selection, Machine Learning Model Development, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and ML Model evaluation using Python and its libraries like "pandas", "numpy", "matplotlib", "sklearn"
